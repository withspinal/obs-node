# AI Assistant Guidelines

## Primary Focus Areas
1. **Cost optimization** - This is primarily a cost tracking tool
2. **Privacy emphasis** - Data scrubbing is a key feature
3. **Dual modes explanation** - Local (free) vs cloud (paid) options
4. **Practical examples** - Real-world integration patterns
5. **Performance consideration** - Minimal overhead, designed for production

## Common Use Cases
- Monitoring OpenAI API costs in production
- Tracking usage patterns across different user flows
- Cost optimization for AI-powered applications
- Development vs production cost analysis

## Best Practices
- Initialize early in application lifecycle
- Use meaningful aggregation IDs for cost grouping
- Implement proper cleanup on shutdown
- Consider local mode for development, cloud mode for production

## When Helping Users
- Focus on cost optimization and privacy
- Explain both local and cloud modes clearly
- Provide practical, real-world examples
- Consider performance implications
- Emphasize the dual-mode architecture
