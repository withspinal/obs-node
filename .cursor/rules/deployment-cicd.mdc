# Deployment & CI/CD

## Release Process
- Version bump triggers automatic npm publish
- Tests must pass before deployment
- Documentation is automatically updated
- Git tags are created for releases

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Linting must pass
- Documentation must be current
- No breaking changes without major version bump

## Workflow Requirements
- Pull request must be merged to main branch
- Automatic version bumping (patch)
- NPM publishing with proper authentication
- Git tag creation and pushing

## Pre-deployment Checks
- Run `npm test` - All unit tests passing
- Run `npm run lint` - No linting errors
- Run `npm run build` - Successful build
- Check documentation completeness
- Verify version consistency

## Post-deployment
- Verify npm package is published
- Check git tags are created
- Validate documentation updates
- Monitor for any deployment issues
